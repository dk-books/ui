Design system distribution from packaging UI components to importing them into other apps. We’ll also uncover time-saving techniques to streamline versioning and release.
Our design system uses JavaScript package manager npm to handle distribution, versioning, and dependency management.

Add @dk-books/ui into your project inc Next v12+ & React v18+.

 	npm i @dk-books/ui

## Storybook 

A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. Developers write multiple stories per component that describe all the “interesting” states a component can support.
Each example component has a set of stories that show the states it supports. You can browse the stories in the UI and see the code behind them in files that end with .stories.tsx.
