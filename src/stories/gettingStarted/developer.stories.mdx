## Storybook 

A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. Developers write multiple stories per component that describe all the “interesting” states a component can support.
Each example component has a set of stories that show the states it supports. You can browse the stories in the UI and see the code behind them in files that end with .stories.tsx. 

## Developers - Component migration guide

Check src/components if there is related your component then you can fill it in with pass props and custom component code better. If its isolate, you can mirate component to right hierarchical e.g src/components/[FOLDER]/[COMPONENT]. stories and test files. js which include your component stories in the needed format.
Restart the server if you've added a component by running npm run storybook.

Add new stories and test file - write demo storybook stories for some example component what should look like.
